  <h1>What I am reading</h1>
  <p>As a kid, in my youth, and during my studies I used to read a lot for pleasure ‚Äî but with a full-time job I rarely take the time.</p>
  <p>So in early 2020, I made a decision to read more books.</p>
  <p>This part of my site serves as a reminder to myself and an open bookshelf to everyone else. Enjoy!</p>
