**metawork** (noun) [^ud]
: 1. Work about work. Much like "metadata" is data about data.
: 2. Trivial or unnecessary work done to avoid having to perform the real task at hand while simultaneously taking the credit for it.

> In the business world, metawork often manifests itself in the form of meetings, mission statements, project planning, or anything else that lets a person become part of the team without actually doing something productive.

In software development, outside of the usual business like meetings and project management, the typical metawork example is _automation_.

I don't know for sure why developers like to do metawork so much, but I have a few ideas.

- Is it because we procrastinate?
- Is it because we are bad at setting priorities?
- Is it because we are perfectionists?
- Is it because we like abstraction and generalization
- We like to build solutions that others can profit from?


The reason why I don't (always) cringe when other developers talk about what they do as _art_ or _craft_ is that software development is one of the few knowledge professions where we get to spend a **lot** of time very close with our tools.


Working on tooling allows us to learn about areas we would't otherwise touch: command line, parsers, file system intricacies, algorithms.

We spend hours perfecting tweaking our design and perfecting our setup, instead of writing articles.

<!-- Tweaking configurations -->

It's also why there is _so much software_ out there, built by developers who were scratching their own itch. The gazillionth todo list app, note taking app or JavaScript framework is not useless --- it's beautiful.

I _love_ metawork.

Here are a few examples that one may not typically think of as metawork.

## Ricing your desktop environment

- ricing community / my own fvwm experiments: it's also where meta dev work meets art
  - Ricing is incredibly creative and productive at the same time.
  - While going through old backups, I found a folder with lots of screenshots I made of my own desktop environments from 2003--2006.

## Bullet Journals

- do you remember bullet journals?

In the meantime, Bullet Journals have gotten a bit of a Ruf. On [r/bulletjournal]() people share...
so much so that there [r/actualbulletjournal] that's really just about the meat of it

## Dotfiles

## Knowledge management

- emacs / gtd setup

## Scratching your own itch / Programming

- a friend of mine is writing a note taking app



- i have a four year old wiki project that's still going on
