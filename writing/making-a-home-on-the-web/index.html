   <h1>Making a Home on the Web</h1>
   
   <!-- Goal: welcome visitors to my site, explain what drove me to redo it, give some nerdy details. -->
<p>Hej you, welcome to my personal website! :hugs:</p>
<p>For the greater part of the last 6 years, this here was nothing more than a digital business card. It was ever so hastily updated every once in a while, any time I applied to a new job --- just to make sure there was nothing obviously embarassing on it.</p>
<p>But in December 2020, while I was stuck in quarantine for more than a week, I got the sudden urge to make <em>something</em> out of this site.</p>
<p>The last year has taken a toll on nearly every person I know, in some way or another. Things we took for granted --- things we assumed to be under our control --- turned out not to be under our control at all.</p>
<p>In the isolation, and with very few local contacts after moving to the Netherlands in 2019, I've also been craving for community, both online and offline --- a sense of community I haven't found on Twitter or any of the other go-to &quot;social&quot; places on the web.</p>
<p>And so in the midst of this, I've decided to carve out my own little space in the <a href="https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse">universe of personal websites</a>. It's not a lot, but it's something I can control. It's a place where I can safely experiment, make mistakes, and battle my own perfectionism, on my own terms. I'm joining many people in a renaissance of the personal website, and I'm excited and curious where this is headed.</p>
<p>On the technical side, I went with the times and dropped the likes of Gatsby and Next (which I value highly for other purposes) for <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>, an old-fashioned (but not old!) static site generator. It's great. So much just works out of the box, and it was a strange pleasure to just write some HTML, some Markdown, and plain CSS.</p>
<p>It's so fast, I even took the libery of adding some web fonts into the mix.</p>
<p class="callout">There's a strange joy in the simple, especially if my daily work involves so much complexity.</p>
<p>I am not sure yet what to make of this site. Evidently, what you are reading right now is something of a blog article. I've tried blogging multiple times, and it always took the same turn as going on a diet or visiting a gym: it did not stick for very long.</p>
<p>As with any habit, I reckon it's because I didn't see the benefits of it quickly enough. This time, therefore, I will not force it, but will take it as it comes and chiefly try to blog <em>for myself</em>. Specifically, I will try to record the small things I've learned and made, and thus create a sort of journal I can return to.</p>
<p>The topics that typically occupy my mind are in the realms of productivity, tooling, the intersection of engineering and design, and life as a developer outside of the technical; but there are personal things I'd like to share, too, <a href="/bookshelf/">such as the books I'm reading</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, while I figure all this out, why don't you take a seat? Please make yourself at home. Bring friends. <em>Wil je een kopje koffie?</em></p>
<p>:coffee:</p>
