title: On time-tracking
---

- recently started to track my working time
- toggl track
- all these pretty graphs speak to me
- on iOS devices, i have "Screen Time"
- used to use rescuetime; shouldn't at work; open source alternative activitywatch; needs to work on linux, of course
- all in all, pretty incomplete picture
- as with everything tracking, the question is: what do i want to learn?
- as pattern-seekers maybe we just want to look at the data and suddenly gain some insight
- for me, however, i had a hunch that i was context switching too often; also, distracted by reddit / hacker news / etc
- even more so now, with working from home all the time
