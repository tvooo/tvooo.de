# The tools I use as the end of 2020

## KDE

I use Linux for work and personal things. Because I started to work from home almost exclusively this year, I recently got a 4K monitor - but little did I know that scaling still _sucks_ on Linux. The only desktop environment that gets this _nearly_ right is KDE. Fractional scaling works great, as long as you're fine with the same scaling on all monitors (not a problem for me, I'm a single-monitor guy).

I now use KDE with pretty much a standard configuration. I got used to it quickly and it works well. All the standard applications that come with KDE completely replaced the Gnome applications I used to use before, and I am planning to replace the custom [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) setup on my personal laptop as well.

## Dotfiles

I had the pleasure of destroying the Fedora installation on my work laptop _twice_ this year, so I got to value my little [dotfiles]() repository.

### Task management & note taking

I reckon for most people these are two very different categories of software. There are even some that say you should definitely keep tasks and notes separate.

For years I had a good solution to task management, namely Todoist, but I struggled with note taking. I went from Evernote to Simplenote to a bunch of Markdown files to Standard Notes and back to a bunch of Markdown files.
