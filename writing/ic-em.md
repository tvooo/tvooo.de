This months marks one and half years since I've moved from an individual contributor (IC) in frontend development into a Team Lead role. About time to do some reflecting.

My job title is _Engineering Team Lead_ and I wear multiple hats: I'm a people manager with a single report (used to be two), a product owner who is responsible for the direction of our design system, and as the most senior engineer on our team, I still do plenty of hands-on technical development work. As the only team lead with a FE background, I was also involved in most FE hiring processes in the company, back when we were still hiring.

How did I end up here? At a former job, also in a Design Systems team, I had a manager in this exact role that I looked up to (and still do). People management was always something I wanted to _try_, but never quite sure if it really was for me.

## Imposter syndrome is still at large

Many people in our industry are prone to imposter syndrome; to some extent, it's normal to worry about your performance when you move not a new company or a new role.

It's been one and a half years and I'm still _terrified_ of failing.

Looking at it objectively, we've achieved some great things in the past year. Besides developing the design system further, we've been adapting to the growth of the company. There is more trust than ever between our stakeholders and ourselves; we're highly productive; we give fast and good support, and collaboration is better than ever.

But to my brain, it's hard to attribute these successes to myself; we're a team after all, right? And we've achieved these things as a team.

I still own my wins in technical work, but of course that's way less than it used to be. These soft things? I own the failures. The team owns the wins.

Luckily, this does not mean that I falsely over prioritise technical work for myself. I still do all the administration, prioritisation and communications work that's needed from me.

- 1. imposter syndrome is not gone yet
- I'm terrified of failing
- objectively, we've been doing great things; steering into right direction
- there's more trust, we're productive, we give fast and good support, better collaboration
- it is hard to attribute any of that to myself. At least for my brain. We're a team after all, right?
- I still attribute the technical stuff, but of course that's way less than it was
- luckily, it does not mean I prioritise tech work for myself; I still do all the admin and prio and comms work. phew.


- manage people older than myself

## With people, the stakes are much higher than with code

This sounds obvious, but I did not realise how much it would effect how I navigate my job.

As an Individual Contributor, you make mistakes that are mostly reversible. In fact, in a healthy environment, you are encouraged to make mistakes and learn from them: write buggy code? There's code review. Break production? We roll it back. Design a flawed API? It's annoying, but there's ways to improve and refactor.

In leadership, if you make mistakes, it can not only cost money (as much of the technical mistakes do). It can cost you the trust of your team - and trust is a lot harder to build than it is to lose. In the worst case, you can affect a person's career permanently.

- 2. Dealing with people is hard
- as IC, if you make mistakes, big deal...
- now, my mistakes can impact people's careers

DS fatigue

I've been lucky to have the best possible environment to do this learning
Great company, support (training, coaching), only two reports, not critical path
One of the most free-to-decide-their-own-path teams (although that can also be a curse).
