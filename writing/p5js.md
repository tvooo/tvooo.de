title: 3D sketching with code
---

My wife and I recently had to remove the railing around the stairs leading up to the first floor. We felt they weren't safe enough, especially as you could, were you to slip on the stairs to the 2nd floor, fall _over_ them and all the way down.

So we planned to replace them. We had a couple of simple ideas in mind, which we were able to talk about and do some rough sketches, but to get a detailed plan - that is, how much wooden planks (?) do we need and how long to they need to be etc - we needed something more detailed.

I decided to try and make a 3d model. I first looked into several

Unity - I need to make an accoutn? I cannot just download it anymore? overly complicated.

Like Codepen but for 3d sketches.

Then I remembered there was a JavaScript version of Processing. I had used Processing back in university, and it's quite approachable. It's also great for anything parametric and generative.
