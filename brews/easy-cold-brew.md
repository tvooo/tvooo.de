# Easy Cold Brew

I don't quite remember where I've learned of this recipe, but it's dead-easy and makes the smoothest cold brew. It takes a bit more time and effort than the [Mizudashi](../mizudashi-cold-brew) version, but you don't need a special bottle for it.

All you need is some sort of funnel with filter (for example, a Melitta, Kalita, or V60 brewer with paper filters) and two caraffes or other vessels with a mouth that can fit 1 liter of water.

## Preparation

1. Grind your coffee really coarse, as for a French Press (Cafetiere).

## Brew

1. Put your grounds in a caraffe and pour the liter of (cold or room temperature) water onto it
2. Give it a good stir with a spoon
3. Leave it in the frige for at least 12 hours

## Filter

4. Put your funnel and filter onto the second caraffe
5. Pour the cold brew from the first caraffe through the funnel into the second caraffe. Discard and replace the filter if it gets to full or clogged.
6. For smoothest results, repeat the process once or twice, pouring into the empty caraffe

## Enjoy! :coffee:

This cold brew is pretty concentrated. I enjoy it the most with a bit of milk and ice!

You can keep it in the fridge for a few days.
