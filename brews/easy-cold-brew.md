# Easy Cold Brew

I don't quite remember where I've learned of this recipe, but it's dead-easy and makes the smoothest cold brew. It takes a bit more time and effort than the [Mizudashi](../mizudashi-cold-brew) version, but you don't need a special bottle for it.

All you need is some sort of funnel with filter (for example, a Melitta, Kalita, or V60 brewer with paper filters) and two caraffes or other vessels with a mouth that can fit 1 liter of water.

## Preparation

Grind your coffee really coarse, as for a French Press (Cafetiere).

## Brew

1. Put your grounds in a caraffe and pour the liter of water onto it
2. Give it a good stir with a spoon
3. Leave it in the frige for at least 12 hours
