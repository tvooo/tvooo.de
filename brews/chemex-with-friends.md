# Chemex with Friends

## Preparation

1. Grind your coffee quite a bit coarser than you would for a V60, and a bit coarser than for a smaller Chemex
2. Put in the paper filter and rinse it with at least 100ml of water. This also preheats the Chemex.
3. Pour out the rinse water

## Brew

_Bloom_

5. Add your grounds to the Chemex and add double the amount of water, or ~100g.<br /> Let it bloom for 45 seconds.

_Main phase_

I tend to be way less structured with a large Chemex than with, say, a V60 recipe, as I do it less often and the water flow is less predictable. So take these more as a rough guide than anything else

6. From the 1-minute mark, add roughly 200g of water
7. Now, whenever it has drained significantly (every 30-60 seconds), add between 100 and 200g of water
8. Finish your brew at 700g and let it drain. This shouldn't take more than 6-7 minutes total (if it does, try a coarser grind next time)

## Enjoy! :coffee:

Make sure to enjoy the coffee quickly, as the Chemex cools down quite fast. And don't forget to share! :blush:
