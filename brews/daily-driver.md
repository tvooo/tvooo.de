# V60 Daily Driver

![](/static/images/v60.jpg)

This recipe is based on a Kalita Wave recipe I've learned while doing a workshop at [Brew Lab](https://www.brewlabcoffee.co.uk/) in Edinburgh. It works just as well with a V60, and I use it with whatever brewer I so happen to fancy (and have filters for) at the time.

## Measurements

Coffee: 19g
Water: 300g
Brew time: ~3 minutes

## Preparation

1. Heat your water to ~95&deg;C
2. While the water is heating, grind your coffee beans medium coarse
3. Put the paper filter into the V60, the V60 on top of your mug (or caraffe), and rinse with ~100g of hot water
4. Pour the water out and zero the scale

## Brew

_Bloom_

5. Add your grounds to the V60 and add double the amount of water, or ~40g.<br /> Let it bloom for 30 seconds

_Slow phase_

6. After the blooming phase, add water up to 100g and wait to 1:00
7. Add another 50g of water, wait to 1:30

_Quick phase_

Now we add 25g every 10 seconds.

At 2:00, we're at 225g
At 2:30, we're at 300g and at the end of our brew.

The rest of the water should be drained out of the coffee bed around the 3 minute mark.

Enjoy! :coffee:
