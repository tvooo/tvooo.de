<p>Hej there, my name is Tim. I'm a Frontend Engineer based in Utrecht.</p>
<p>I make medical research more effective at <a href="miau">Castor</a></p>

<p>
  My work focuses on <strong>design systems</strong> and
  <strong>accessibility</strong>. Having a hybrid designer-developer background
  myself, I strive to improve how design and engineering teams collaborate, and
  I help scale frontend engineering practices sustainably across the whole
  organization.
</p>

<p>
  The web is a platform with enormous impact on our everyday lives, and I
  believe it should be open and inclusive to everyone, no matter their cognitive
  or physical abilities.
</p>

<p>
  In my spare time I learn Dutch, make music, ride the bicycle, and listen to
  math rock. I also make a great cup of coffee!
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Code</strong> is the material I design with. Find my open source work
  on Github and my ramblings on Twitter.
